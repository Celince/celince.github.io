    <p>Hello! I'm Celince Kapadia, currently in my final year of Information Technology studies at York University. <br>My journey through the IT landscape has been marked by a keen desire to learn and grow. Through internships, <br>I've dipped my toes in various aspects of technology, from software development to cybersecurity, <br> each experience broadening my understanding and fueling my curiosity for more.
<br> <br>
In the field, I've learned the importance of adaptability and problem-solving, skills that have turned challenges into opportunities for growth. <br>My academic path has been complemented by hands-on experiences where I've contributed to projects, honing my technical and <br>collaborative skills. I'm constantly exploring new technologies, eager to expand my toolkit and apply these innovations in real-world scenarios.
<br><br>
As I approach the end of my university chapter, I'm looking forward to bringing my blend of knowledge, experience, and enthusiasm to new opportunities. <br>I'm excited about the prospect of joining a team where I can contribute, learn, and grow together.
